      "[1] «As far as I remember, High Memory is used for application space and Low Memory for the kernel. Advantage is that (user-space) applications cant access kernel-space memory.»\n",
      "[2] «The first reference to turn to is Linux Device Drivers (available both online and in book form), particularly chapter 15 which has a section on the topic. In an ideal world, every system component would be able to map all the memory it ever needs to access. And this is the case for processes on Linux and most operating systems: a 32-bit process can only access a little less than 2^32 bytes of virtual memory (in fact about 3GB on a typical Linux 32-bit architecture). It gets difficult for the kernel, which needs to be able to map the full memory of the process whose system call its executing, plus the whole physical memory, plus any other memory-mapped hardware device. So when a 32-bit kernel needs to map more than 4GB of memory, it must be compiled with high memory support. High memory is memory which is not permanently mapped in the kernels address space. (Low memory is the opposite: it is always mapped, so you can access it in the kernel simply by dereferencing a pointer.) When you access high memory from kernel code, you need to call kmap first, to obtain a pointer from a page data structure (struct page). Calling kmap works whether the page is in high or low memory. There is also kmap_atomic which has added constraints but is more efficient on multiprocessor machines because it uses finer-grained locking. The pointer obtained through kmap is a resource: it uses up address space. Once youve finished with it, you must call kunmap (or kunmap_atomic) to free that resource; then the pointer is no longer valid, and the contents of the page cant be accessed until you call kmap again.»\n",
      "[3] «Linux memory management (MM) does seem to be a bit arcane and challenging to track down. Linux literature makes heavy mention of LRU (Least Recently Used), in the context of memory management. I havent noticed any of the other terms being mentioned. I found an interesting introduction (first four paragraphs) in this article on the incomparable LWN.net. It explains how basic LRU can be implemented in practice for virtual memory. Read it. True LFU (Least Frequently Used) replacement is not considered practical for virtual memory. The kernel cant count every single read of a page, when mmap() is used to access file cache pages - e.g. this is how most programs are loaded in memory. The performance overhead would be far too high. To go beyond that simple concept, there is a design outline around Linux version 2.6.28-32 here: http://linux-mm.org/PageReplacementDesign It suggests Clock-PRO is used for file pages. There is an original paper available on it. There is an old description of Clock-PRO on LWN.net, again including some practical implementation details. Apparently Clock-PRO attempts to move beyond the LRU approach, a variant of which is used in most systems. It seems to put more weight on frequency. Linux-mm has another design document for implementing Clock-PRO in Linux. This one doesnt talk about it being merged in; it was written a few months before the LWN article about it. http://linux-mm.org/ClockProApproximation More recent descriptions are that Linux merely uses some ideas from Clock-PRO, and is actually a mash of a number of different algorithms with a number of modifications for catching corner cases and various optimisations. The above quote was answered a question by Adrian McMenamin. McMenamin went on to complete an MSc project in 2011, testing modifications to Linux page replacement based on the working set model. It includes a brief description of Linux page replacement. The variant of LRU is named as the 2Q [two-queue] approach for database management, a number of references are provided, and there is a diagram illustrating movement between the two queues and other state transitions. He also describes Linux as using a partial implementation of CLOCK-PRO. I expect the LRU concept, as opposed to the other possibilities you mention, was established from the start. And the most significant change was the introduction of Clock-PRO based features, i.e. putting some more weight on frequency. In 2013 Linux gained thrash detection-based file cache sizing. This is probably also relevant to the question.»\n",
      "[4] «HIGHMEM is a range of kernels memory space, but it is NOT memory you access but its a place where you put what you want to access. A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like: 0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB) 0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB) (CPU-specific vector and whatsoever are ignored here). Linux splits the 1GB kernel space into 2 pieces, LOWMEM and HIGHMEM. The split varies from installation to installation. If an installation chooses, say, 512MB-512MB for LOW and HIGH mems, the 512MB LOWMEM (0xc0000000-0xdfffffff) is statically mapped at the kernel boot time; usually the first so many bytes of the physical memory is used for this so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have a constant offset of, say, 0xc0000000. On the other hand, the latter 512MB (HIGHMEM) has no static mapping (although you could leave pages semi-permanently mapped there, but you must do so explicitly in your driver code). Instead, pages are temporarily mapped and unmapped here so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have no consistent mapping. Typical uses of HIGHMEM include single-time data buffers.»\n",
      "[5] «This is an old post, however, I would still take the liberty of putting up my thoughts here. Starting from down under, Linux would first divide the memory into pages (usually 4K per page on x86_64 system). Thereafter, virtual memory is created, whose mapping is done with physical memory using MMU (Memory Management Unit). Processes are allocated memory from the virtual memory area, so please note, when you see /proc/meminfo, you will see VMalloc* as the virtual memory details. Lets say you have a process which requests for memory (say 300MB - a web browser). The process would be allocated 300MB from the virtual memory, however, it is not necessary it is memory mapped (that is mapped to physical memory). There is concept of Copy on Write for memory management, whereby, if your processes actually uses the memory allocated from virtual memory (that is it does some write on the memory), only then it is mapped to physical memory. This assists the kernel to work properly in a multi-process environment efficiently. What are cache? A lot of memory used by processes are shared. Lets say the glibc library is used by almost all processes. What is the point of keeping multiple copies of glibc in the memory, when every process could access same memory location and do the job. Such frequently used resources are kept in cache so that when processes demand, they could be referenced to same memory location. This helps in speeding up processes, as reading glibc(etc.) again & again from disk would be time consuming. The above was for shared libraries per say, similar is also true to file reading as well. If you read a large file (say 100-200MB) for the first time, it would take a lot of time. However, when you try and do the same read again, it would be faster. Data was cached in memory, and re-read was not done for all blocks. What is buffer? As far as buffer is concerned, when a processes does file I/O, it relies on kernels buffer to write data to disk. The processes, requests the kernel to do the job. So, on behalf of the process, the kernel writes the data to its buffer, and tells process that the write is done. In an async manner, kernel will keep syncing this data in buffer to disk. In this way, the processes is relying on the kernel to choose a correct time to sync data to disk, and the processes could continue working ahead. Remember, this is general I/O that normal processes are doing. However, specialized processes, which need to confirm that I/O is actually done on the disk can use other mechanism to do I/O on disk. Some of opensource utilities are libaio. Also, there are ways to call explicit sync to FDs opened in your processes context, so that you force the kernel the kernel to sync the data to disk for the write you might have done. What are page faults then? Consider an example, when you start a process (say a web browser), whose binary is about 300MB. However, the complete 300MB of the web browser binary does not start working instantly. The process keeps moving from functions-to-functions in its code. As said earlier, Virtual Memory would be 300MB consumed however, not all is memory mapped to physical memory (RSS - resident memory would be less, see top output). When code execution reaches a point, for which memory is not actually physically mapped, a page fault would be issues. Kernel would map this memory to physical, associate the memory page to your process. Such a page fault is called Minor Page Faults. Similarly speaking, when a process is doing file I/O major page faults are raised. When and why Swap Out happens? Situation 1: Inline with the details above, lets consider a scenario when the good amount of memory becomes memory mapped. And now a processes starts up, which requires memory. As discussed above, kernel will have do some memory mapping. However, there not enough physical RAM available to map the memory. Now, the kernel will first look into the cache, it will have some old memory pages which are not being used. It will flush those pages onto a separate partition (called SWAP), free up some pages, and map freed pages to the new request coming. As disk write is much slower than solid-state RAM, this process takes a lot of time, and hence a slow down is seen. Situation 2: Lets say you see a lot of free memory available in the system. Even then you see that there is a lot of swap-out happening. There could be a probable issue of memory fragmentation. Consider a processes, which demands 50MB of contiguous memory from kernel. (keep in mind contiguous). Obviously, the kernel would have allocated pages randomly to different processes, and freed some of them. However, when we demand contiguous memory, it will have to look for a chunk which satifies the processes demand. If it is not able to get such a memory, it will have to do a swap-out of some old memory pages and then allocate contiguous ones. Even in such cases SWAP out would happen. Starting Kernel ver 2.6 and above, such fragmentation problems have reduced considerably. However, if the system is running for a long time, such problems could still come.
